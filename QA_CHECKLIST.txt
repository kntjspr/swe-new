# FitTracker - QA Test Cases 

## AUTHENTICATION
- Sign in flow works and redirects to dashboard
- Sign out works and redirects to landing page
- Protected routes (/dashboard, /generate, /saved, /history) redirect unauthenticated users to landing
- Session persists across page refreshes

## LANDING PAGE
- Header shows logo, nav links, and Sign In/Dashboard button based on auth state
- Hero section has proper spacing from header (not overlapping)
- Main marquee ("Strength/Endurance/Power/Hypertrophy") scrolls continuously without gaps
- Footer marquee scrolls in reverse continuously
- Features grid displays 4 cards in proper layout
- Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- Black background covers entire viewport

## DASHBOARD
- Loads with stats cards (Completed, Calories, Minutes, Coverage)
- Muscle heatmap highlights trained muscles in orange
- Recent activity shows last 5 workouts with name, date, duration, muscle tags
- Empty state shows when no workouts exist
- Loading spinner displays during data fetch

## GENERATE WORKOUT
- Muscle selector allows clicking muscle groups (highlights in orange)
- Equipment toggles work (Bodyweight, Dumbbells, Barbell, Cable) - at least one required
- Duration slider adjusts 15-120 minutes
- Difficulty selector works (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Generate button creates workout with exercises
- Generated workout shows: name, duration, calories, difficulty, exercise list
- Each exercise shows: name, muscles, sets, reps, rest, equipment, tip
- Exercise cards expand to show full details
- Save workout button saves to database with optional custom name
- Regenerate button creates new workout with same parameters
- Validation error if no muscles selected

## SAVED WORKOUTS
- Displays list of saved workout templates
- Each workout shows: name, muscles, duration, difficulty, action buttons
- Delete button removes workout from list and database
- Start button logs workout to history
- Empty state shows when no saved workouts
- Muscle tags show up to 3, then "+X more"

## HISTORY
- Displays list of completed workout logs
- Each log shows: name, completion date, duration, calories, muscles
- Dates format as "Today", "Yesterday", "X days ago", or formatted date
- Empty state shows when no history
- Logs sorted by date (most recent first)

## SIDEBAR (Desktop)
- Navigation links work (Dashboard, Generator, Saved, History)
- Active page highlighted in orange
- User profile shows avatar, name, sign out button
- Logo displays at top

## MOBILE
- Mobile header shows on screens <768px
- Bottom navigation shows all pages and highlights active
- Floating "Generate Workout" CTA on dashboard
- All pages responsive without horizontal scroll
- Touch interactions work

## STYLING & THEME
- Consistent orange (#FF4B00), black, monospace font throughout
- Space Mono font loads correctly
- Text selection shows orange background with white text
- Hover states work on buttons, links, cards
- Smooth transitions on interactions

## API ENDPOINTS
- GET /api/stats returns workout statistics
- GET /api/workouts returns saved workouts
- POST /api/workouts creates new workout
- DELETE /api/workouts/:id deletes workout
- POST /api/workouts/generate generates AI workout
- GET /api/history returns workout logs
- POST /api/history creates workout log
- All endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- Error responses show user-friendly messages

## DATABASE
- Data persists across sessions
- Users only see their own data (user isolation)
- Muscle groups stored and retrieved correctly as arrays

## PERFORMANCE
- Pages load within 2-3 seconds
- npm run build completes successfully with no errors
- Images use Next.js Image component

## ACCESSIBILITY
- Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Space)
- Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Images have alt text

## EDGE CASES
- Long workout names (100+ chars) truncate/wrap properly
- Cannot deselect all equipment (at least one required)
- Duration slider caps at 120 minutes
- Concurrent users don't interfere with each other

## ERROR HANDLING
- Network failures show user-friendly error messages
- Invalid/corrupted data handled gracefully
- API timeouts handled with loading states

## SECURITY
- XSS attacks prevented (scripts sanitized)
- SQL injection prevented (parameterized queries)
- Gemini API key only used server-side, never exposed to client
- Production uses HTTPS

## CRITICAL PATH (Priority Testing)
1. Sign in → redirects to dashboard
2. Dashboard loads with stats and heatmap
3. Navigate to /generate
4. Select muscles, equipment, duration, difficulty
5. Generate workout → displays exercises
6. Save workout → appears in /saved
7. Start workout from /saved → logs to /history
8. View history → shows completed workout
9. Sign out → redirects to landing

## KNOWN FEATURES
- AI workout generation via Gemini API with heuristic fallback
- Neon Postgres database for data storage
- Stack Auth for authentication
- Next.js 15 App Router
- Tailwind CSS with custom orange/black/mono theme
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- SVG muscle selector with interactive highlighting
- Real-time stats calculation from workout logs
